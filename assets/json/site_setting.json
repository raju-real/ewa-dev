    "about_us": "<p>The objectives of employee welfare are to improve the life of the working class, to bring about holistic development of the worker&rsquo;s personality and so on. Employee welfare is in the interest of employee, employer and the society as a whole. It enables workers to perform their work in healthy and favorable environment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, it improves efficiency of workers and keeps them content, thereby contributing to high employee morale. It also develops a sense of responsibility and dignity amongst the workers and thus makes them good citizens of the nation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the wages and salary, anything done by the organization to improve the living standard of employees and keep them contented comes under the realm of employee welfare. All those services, benefits and facilities offered to employees by the employer to make his life worth living, are included in employee welfare.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to ILO, &ldquo;Employee welfare should be understood as such service, facilities and amenities which may be established in or in the vicinity of undertakings to enable the persons employed in them to perform their work in healthy and peaceful surroundings and to avail of facilities which improve their health and bring high morale&rdquo;.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>ADVERTISEMENTS:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employee welfare is for the betterment of the workers. It involves adjustment of an employee&rsquo;s work life and family life to the community and social life. Welfare measures may be both voluntary and statutory (prescribed under labour laws).<\/p>",
